                <p>We live in a disconnected and battery powered world, but our technology and best practices are a leftover from the always connected and steadily powered past.</p>
                <p>We make sure your app is always available even if your on the subway or travelling abroad without internet access.</p>

                <blockquote class="color-1">If you are not paying for it, you're not the customer, you're the product being sold</blockquote>
                <p>We often sacrifice some part of our privacy (think e-mail, digital photography, private messaging) to companies that provide a service. But behind the scenes your valuable data can be sold for advertisement purposes or even used for surveillance
                    via Governments.</p>
                <p>We think there is a better, safer and secure way to start making privacy a central focus for applications moving forward. It starts with you and your phone.</p>
